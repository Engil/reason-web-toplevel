# reason-web-toplevel [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Engil/reason-web-toplevel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Engil/reason-web-toplevel)
A Reason web toplevel built using js_of_ocaml

To make this word, you need

- The latest git version of BetterErrors: the one released on opam contains a typo preventing us to build correctly a javascript version of it.


- `js_of_ocaml` 2.7, haven't tested 2.8.


- Higlo must be installed, preferably from this branch to get reason syntax highlighting workinig: https://github.com/Engil/higlo/tree/reason-lexer
